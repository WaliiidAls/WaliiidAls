# Hi, I'm Waleed 👋.

* 🔭 I am a full stack developer, which means I can build a ~~computer~~ website.  
* 🎶 I'm interested in every sport that involves skating 🛹, surf 🏄‍♂️, and Ice skate ⛸.
* 🌱 I am addicted to coffee ☕️.
* 🙊 Don't tell Omar, once I knew Swift, sadly, I don't anymore.
* ⚡ Fun fact: I started to learn to program so I can buy a coffee machine, happily, I made it. It made 2020 bearable.
