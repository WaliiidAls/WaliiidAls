# Hi there 👋.

🔭 I’m always self-learning how to code everything.  
🌱 I’m about to become a full-stack developer, marketing, and sometimes digging deepere in SwiftUI.  
🎶 I'm interested in everything related to art. I sing 🎤, I draw 🎨, I design 🖌, but I don't play guitar 🎸.  
⚡ Fun fact: I learnt progrmaming in 17th to get some money to do buy coffee machine ☕️, I finally did it, it made 2020 bearable.  
🙊 Sad fact: I used to know Swift, but not anymore.
📫 How to reach me: I only retweet memes on twitter/waliiidals, I share my daily life on instagram/waliiidals.
